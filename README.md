Q: Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

> The Gaming Room (client) desired to expand their existing web-based multiplayer game towards mobile devices, with the intention of reaching a wider audience.
> The software is expected to render images over a short, discrete time period while the game's players make guesses as to the identity of the pictured object.
> The software will need to perform on Android and iOS operating systems in addition to functioning in Windows/Mac/Linux users' browsers.


Q: What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

> I felt I did well qualifying the client's needs in version 1.0, and translating these needs to our requirements.


Q: What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

> The design document helps us think conceptually about our code before we begin assembling our logic.
> This roadmap keeps everyone on the development team on the same page.


Q: If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

> I would perhaps do more research into current server options and better define prices and availability for the Evaluation, as well.
> I accidentally forgot to update the cover page to display the correct version number in the third iteration of the design document. It displays 'version 2.0' despite the changelog correctly indicating that the document has been updated to its version 3.0.


Q: How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

> The client's specifications were qualified in the design document, and from here it fell to the developers to envision and optimize the user's experience, as well.
> For example, we know that a game player does not want to sit through latency when playing the short, rapid-fire rounds of the game. Latency may mean the difference between winning and losing a round, and may make the game unfair based on a user's network connectivity. Knowing this, we can take steps to ascertain that each image is transmitted before rounds begin, so that image rendering takes place entirely on the client's side.
> Without considering user needs, it is not possible to deliver a well-performing product. In the end, it is the user, not the client, who will be 


Q: How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?”

> The most valuable technique was thoroughly analyzing client, user, and technical requirements. The design document is incredibly helpful. I learned very early in my computer science education that pseudocode and planning make or break the program; similarly, without thorough evaluation of requirements, development is directionless.
